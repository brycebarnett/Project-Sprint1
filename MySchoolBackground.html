<h1>My Educational Foundation</h1>

   <p>I have had some valuable professional experience in my time in school. These roles have been in a variety of industries, roles and companies. In the past, I have worked in graphic design, retail sales, autonomous sales, etc. These roles have provided me with a wide perspective of the business world and all it entails. I am greatful for these past expereinces, and the preparation that it provided me in my career devlopment.</p>
   
   <p>In my coursework at the University of Iowa, I have worked hands-on with some great organizations. The Find211 project that I am completing during my Business Analytics capstone is one of the best. In this project, I have had the blessing of creating a universal site for individuals in need here in the U.S. These resources range from food security, mental health resources and many more. I am extremely thankful for the help that I received from sponor Kristy Walker, Professor Emmanuel Peters and Hannah Baucom.</p>
